<h1>Personal Decision Makng App - Step 1: UI Setup, Basic Input Handling & Modular Output</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3> This app will help me decide what to make for dinner. This step sets up the basic look and gets input capture and console loggin working using a modular approach.

<h3>My Decision Focus:</h3> This app will have different dinner ideas depending on what the person inputs. I will have to research and find ideas or recipes to add in here but I'm excited about doing this project. Hopefully this app will help me decide what to eat for dinner.

<h3>Decision Logic:</h3> I need to add more functions but these are the ones I have so far. 
    <h4>Food Choice:</h4>
        -When pizza is picked and also the money is over 10 and the time is 5 or 6 then the decision is to have pizza.
        -When pizza is picked and the money is less than 10, the answer is no pizza.
        -When pizza is picked and the time is after 6 then the answer is no pizza.
        -When burrito is picked, it doesn't matter the time or money so the answer is burritos.
        -When chicken nuggets is picked, it doesn't matter the time or money so the answer is chicken nuggets.
       
<h3>Input Types Used</h3>: I used the text input for my question about huner level because I felt like it could benefit the user to be able to write in their own number. I used the number input for how many people are going to be eating with you. And then I used radio buttons for what kinds of foods might sound good to the user. I think these are relevant to my project because each question or input field needs those specific funtions. The radio button could be something else but I liked it.

<h3>Color Palette</h3>: I chose nice green colors that are not too harsh on the eyes but still very appealing and readable. #cad2c5 #84a98c #52796f #354f52 #2f3e46
